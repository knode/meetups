## Formats

### Presentations

We meet once a month on the 4th Tuesday somewhere in Wellington. We sometimes move around but are looking for a
permanent office to meet in. We usually have two presentations which we like to keep informal. They usually last
perhaps 20 mins, but we encourage talk and questions through each presentation, so they're usually about 40 mins with a
break in between.

Some people head to the pub afterwards for a drink and a social.

## Process

Organised via MeetUp. We are always looking for speakers and venues, so please contact the organisers.
