## Formats

### Talk Night

Talk nights are held on the first Thursday of the month. They are usually
comprised of one 15 minute lightning talk with two long-form (30-45 minute)
talks.  Attendees are encouraged to ask questions and interact with the speaker
(in a polite way!)

After the meetup, PDXNode usually relocates as a group to one of a few
nearby bars.

### Hack Night

Hack nights are held on 3rd Thursdays, colocating with [SEPoCoNi](http://epdx.org/groups/sepoconi) ("Southeast
Portland Coders Night") at Side Door, a coffee shop/diner/bar. The structure is free-form with a focus on socializing and hacking.Organizers greet newbies and ask what they'd like to work on or if they have any projects they'd like help with. Those new to Node are directed to learning resources, including [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io).

### Workshops

Workshops are currently a WIP; most organizers also TA for the local JavaScript
code school.

## Process

Talks are submitted via PR and reviewed by organizers. Talk templates are 
provided. Note that this is not a case of "build it and they will come".
Organizers actively seek out and encourage talks from community members. 
Newer members are encouraged to do lightning talks. Topics include packages 
they've recently released or found useful, tooling, and brief tutorials.

There's also a "request for talk" to allow members who are interested in
a topic request to hear about it at a future meetup. The request provides
inspiration for those who want to give a talk.

Once a talk is accepted it is placed in a `YYYY-MM` directory. Additional
talk resources should be added / linked to from there (presentations, code
examples, etc.)
