## Format

We meet once a month in the event room of a bar in Cobble Hill called [61 Local](http://www.61local.com/). Tickets are $10/$15/$20 dollars, depending on when a ticket is purchased, and all proceeds go to charity. Historically we have been splitting between [Girls Who Code](http://www.girlswhocode.com/) and [ScriptEd](http://scripted.org/), but we are open to taking suggestions from the community for more organizations, preferably NYC-based.

We do things lightning talk style: five 10 minute slots, with 5 minutes for speaking and 5 minutes for questions. After the talks, everyone goes downstairs for the beer.js portion of the evening to enjoy local beers and sodas. The ticket comes with a custom 3D printed token that can be redeemed for a beverage of choice.

## Process

### Obtaining a Ticket

Tickets are announced via the [@brooklyn_js](https://twitter.com/brooklyn_js) twitter account. We release tickets in batches, about half of them two weeks out and the rest about one week out. Tickets tend to sell out very fast so the best way to get one is to keep a close eye on the twitter stream, or better yet, to submit a talk.

### Sponsoring a Meetup

In addition to the normal tickets, we also offer sponsor tickets. Sponsors help us defray expenses and help us to donate more money to the charitable organizations we support. Sponsors get two tickets to be used by their developers and they get the opportunity to give our attendees a 30-second pitch about their company.

### Becoming a Speaker
We accept talk proposals through pull request: whoever wants to give a talk [makes a PR to the website](https://github.com/brooklynjs/brooklynjs.github.io) adding their name to the schedule. PRs are generally accepted for about two weeks between meetups and we decide our lineup at the end of those two weeks. We actively encourage members of the community to submit talks, especially if they have not spoken before. Those who submit talks also get first dibs on tickets, even if their proposal is not accepted.
