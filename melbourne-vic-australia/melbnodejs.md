## Formats


### Talk Night

Talk nights are held once in every month. They are usually
comprised of three 20 minute-long talks with a short break in between.

Ideally, we have one very beginner friendly talk and one "hacker-friendly"

We also try each time to move to a new venue and ask attendees to considering their company as a host next time

### Workshops

Nodeschool every few month

## Process

The talks are discussed via meetup.com, github issues or email. Presentations posted to http://nodejs.org.au/#posts after meetup
